# üí¨ Tuiter Overview

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is it?

Tuiter is a social media platform where users can sign up, add friends, and express themselves through posts! Tuiter posts support text, pictures, and videos, and if you like someone else's post you can even Retuit it! If you Tuit something and then later regret it (which happens often on social media), you can delete it!

As a programmer new to website development, I made Tuiter to understand several of the many technologies that can be used to create a website. I created Tuiter to gain some practice in web development, and have a project that would allow me to explore some of the most commonly used tools in this sector of software engineering. This project showed me that I truly love web development, and one day I aspire to be a front-end engineer.

## üíª Technologies

Tuiter implements JavaScript and React to increase user-interaction, letting users post content and view profiles. It employs HTML for structure and CSS for colors, styling, and intuitive navigation through 9 user-friendly pages. It utilizes Bootstrap for layout and MongoDB to pull content from libraries and allow users to create Tuiter accounts. Lastly, it incorporates Redux to handle state management across the application.

TL;DR:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Redux

# Running Tuiter on Your Local Machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
